# Alfred Workflow: Topicz

**Update September 2021**: as I'm not using this tool anymore, I'm archiving it. It shares its fate with the underlying topicz tool.

## Introduction

This workflow integrates my own [topicz](https://github.com/voostindie/topicz) command-line tool within Alfred.

## Installation

Download the workflow file and double-click it. Provided you have Alfred on your machine, that should install it.
